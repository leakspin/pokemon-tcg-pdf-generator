# Play! Pokémon TCG PDF Generator
This website is a tool for players of Pokémon TCG.  
If you compete in official events, you need to fill a PDF with all the cards included in your deck. This website allows you to fill all the data in a form and generate the official PDF file with the introduced data. Also, it allows you to save your already introduced data to later reuse it.
